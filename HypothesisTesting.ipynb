    "### Project Hypothesis Testing:   “Free Trial” Screener\n",
    "----\n",
    "**Project description**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity is an online learning system (https://www.udacity.com/).  At the time of the experiment, Udacity courses had two options on the course overview page: \"start free trial\", and \"access course materials\". If the student clicks \"start free trial\", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. If the student clicks \"access course materials\", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \"start free trial\", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message will appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough time—without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\n",

    "Columns:\n",
    "- Pageviews: Number of unique cookies to view the course overview page that day. \n",
    "- Clicks: Number of unique cookies to click the course overview page that day. \n",
    "- Enrollments: Number of user-ids to enroll in the free trial that day. \n",
    "- Payments: Number of user-ids who enrolled on that day to remain enrolled for 14 days and thus make a payment. (Note that the date for this column is the start date, that is, the date of enrollment, rather than the date of the payment. The payment happened 14 days later. Because of this, the enrollments and payments are tracked for 14 fewer days than the other columns.)\n"

    "To give you an additional opportunity to add a few more data science project experience into your portfolio.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So please put maximum effort to demonstrate your skill in this project. Answer the quiz with diligence, and perform the data analysis as best as you can. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed instruction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Git Fork/Clone the project jupyter notebooks and the corresponding data from this github: https://github.com/10acad/piq2019\n",
    "The jupyter notebook “HypothesisTesting.ipynb”, which contains this instruction in the first markdown cell, is for this project.\n",
    "- The “data/UdacityABtesting.xlsx” excel file is the data for this project\n",
    "- Following the recommended tasks below, perform A/B testing and Machine learning analysis on the data while at the same time answering the questions listed below.\n",
    "- At the minimum you must perform an analysis that will allow you to answer the questions, visualize features, and produce a model to draw a reasonable conclusion. The more detailed your data analysis and clear answers to the quiz, the better it will be for your selection as 10 Academy Fellow as well as you stand a better chance to get a job interviews. Note that these notebooks and your other work at Github are critical for your Data Science Career - as they are the evidence to your skills. So even after submitting whatever you managed to do by the deadline, keep improving your model and explanations.  \n",
    "- PLEASE SUBMIT WHATEVER YOU MANAGED TO DO BEFORE THE DEADLINE. WE KNOW THE TIME IS SHORT, AND IT IS FOR A PURPOSE. \n",
    "- Upload your jupyter notebook to your Github public repository. If you have forked Github link above, which is what we recommend, then you just have to do the following \n",
    "    - git add -u *  #add all modified files tracked by git \n",
    "    - git commit -m ‘submit’ \n",
    "    - git push\n",
    "- Copy the Github link to your version of “HypothesisTesting.ipynb” and paste it here (the 10 Academy quiz page). If you prefer, there is also a possibility to directly upload your jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- If you have any questions or confusions regarding what you are expected to do in this project or how to submit, please contact community@10academy.org well before the deadline.\n"

    "\n",
    "- In frequentist analysis, mostly used for A/B testing, we use p-values to measure the significance of the experimental feature over the null hypothesis (the hypothesis that the new feature does not have an impact). How are p-values computed? What information do p-values provide? Are you familiar with type-I and type-II errors? Can you comment to which error types p-values are related? \n",

    "\n",

Remember that running the experiment longer may be costly for many reasons, so you should always optimize the number of samples to make a statistically sound decision. \n",
